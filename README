Limitations

While Producer Pal is powerful, understanding its limitations will help you work more effectively and
avoid frustration. 
These limitations exist because certain Ableton Live features require direct
interaction with the software's user interface or file system.

Library and Browser Access (New!) (By me)
Producer Pal can now browse and load content from Ableton's library through the ppal-read-browser
and ppal-load-item tools. You can:
- Browse library categories (instruments, audio effects, user library, etc.)
- Search for presets, and samples by name
- Load devices, presets, audio and midi effects  directly into tracks
This includes  instrument presets, effect presets,
user libraries, and factory content.
It still cant load audio samples into drum racks, cant load drum ableton drum kits into a midi channel.

Cannot Record
Recording audio or MIDI input is not supported. Producer Pal creates content programmatically by
writing notes and configuring devices, but it cannot capture real-time performances from your
instruments or MIDI controllers.

Cannot Load External Plugins
Third-party VST and AU plugins cannot be loaded by Producer Pal. Only native Ableton devices can
be created. However, if you manually load a plugin, Producer Pal may be able to read and modify
some of its parameters, depending on how the plugin exposes them to Ableton.

Cannot Export
Exporting and rendering functions are not available. You must export your final audio or video files
manually through Ableton Live's export menu.
